# ClusterEnsemble

The objective of this project is to assess the improvements in prediction accuracy by using a cluster ensemble with commercial data. The project illustrates implementation of the idea proposed in "A comparative study of clustering ensemble algorithms".

#### Requires: 
- numpy >= ??
- pandas >= ??
- sklearn >= ??
- matplotlib >= ??

## Data:
- [Elo, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation/discussion)
- [Red Hat, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value/data)
- [Instacart, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/kernels)

## To do list:
- [ ] Create data structures
- [ ] Perform single clustering
- [ ] Perform cluster ensemble
- [ ] Baseline prediction
- [ ] Prediction with single clustering
- [ ] Prediction with cluster ensemble
- [ ] Comparative analysis
