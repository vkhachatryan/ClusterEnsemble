# Cluster Ensemble for Commercial Data

The objective of this project is to assess the improvements in prediction accuracy by using a cluster ensemble with commercial data. The project illustrates implementation of the idea proposed in "A comparative study of clustering ensemble algorithms".

#### Requires: 
- numpy >= 1.15.4
- pandas >= 0.23.4
- matplotlib >= 3.0.2
- xgboost >= 0.81
- catboost >= 0.12.2

### Data:
- [Elo, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation/discussion)
- [Red Hat, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value/data)
- [Instacart, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/kernels)

### To do list:
- [x] Create data structures
- [x] Perform single clustering
- [x] Perform cluster ensemble
- [x] Baseline prediction
- [x] Prediction with single clustering
